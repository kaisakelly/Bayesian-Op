# Rearrangement Config

# setting splitting strategy in DataRearrangement. User can change it
# to 'sequential' if the provided data is well shuffled.
# Learn more about DataRearrangement Strategy at
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/data-rearrangement.html
STRATEGY = "random"

# setting the seed for 'random' splitting in DataRearrangement.
# If the splitting strategy is not 'random', then this setting
# is a no-op. Changing the random seed will result in different
# way to split the original data, which may impact the predictive
# performance metric.
